# Tutorial - Capturing data from service calls

## What you'll learn

 1. How Granitic captures data from HTTP web service calls and binds it to your application's data structures
 
## Prerequisites

 1. Follow the Granitic [installation instructions](https://github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/blob/master/doc/installation.md)
 2. Read the [before you start](000-before-you-start.md) tutorial
 3. Either have completed [tutorial 3](003-logging.md) or open a terminal and run

<pre>
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/graniticio
git clone https://github.com/graniticio/granitic-examples.git
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/graniticio/granitic-examples/tutorial
./prepare-tutorial.sh 4
</pre>

## Data capture

Granitic's core purpose is to streamline the process of building web and micro services in Go. 
One of the most time consuming aspects of buliding web services is writing code to read inbound data from an HTTP request 
and binding that data to your application's data structures. This tutorial explains how Granitic makes this easier (the next tutorial will cover the [validation](005-validation.md) of the data you capture).

Web services that are provided as HTTP endpoints generally allow callers to supply _data_ in three different parts of the HTTP request:

1. The HTTP request's body
2. The [path](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.2.2) component of the URL
3. The [query](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.2.2) component of the URL

or some combination of the above. Granitic automates the process of extracting these three types of data from the request and mapping the data to fields on your application's data structures.


### Web service design patterns

Granitic is agnostic as to which web service design pattern (REST, RPC etc) your application follows. The majority of the examples in these tutorials are 'REST-like',
but that is not to suggest that Granitic favours REST over other patterns.

### Meta-data

Callers of HTTP web services may also supply _meta-data_ about the request as [request headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.3). Granitic gives you application access to these headers but does not
currently offer a way of automatically binding those headers to your data structures.


## Path and query binding

Our tutorial application already supports a single GET endpoint to allow us to recover the details of a recording artist. Start your tutorial application:

<pre>
cd $GOPATH/src/granitic-tutorial/recordstore
grnc-bind
go build
./recordstore -c resource/config,resource/env/production.json
</pre>

and visit [http://localhost:8080/artist](http://localhost:8080/artist) to see what happens when you execute a GET request.

We want to allow the caller of this endpoint to specify _which_ artist they'd like details for. Open <code>endpoint/artist.go</code> and
add the following struct to the end of the file.

```go
type ArtistRequest struct {
  ID int
  NormaliseName *types.NilableBool
}
```

Make sure you add <code>github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/types</code> to that file's list of imports if your IDE hasn't already done it for you.

### Nilable types

A side-effect of Go's system of [zero values](https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value) for variables is that it can make recovering data from web service calls
ambiguous. For example, if you accept a boolean via a query parameter and the value of the boolean is <code>false</code>, how does your code know if it's false because:

 * The caller explictly set the value to false or
 * The caller didn't supply that parameter at all, so the variable just defaulted to false.
 
Granitic's soltuion this problem is to provide a set of 'nilable' struct versions of primitive types ([see the Godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/types)) that provide additional methods to indicate whether the value was explicity set by the caller
or was an automatic zero value.

## Configuring path binding

A common REST-like technique is to allow a caller to specify the ID of the required resource (in this case a recording artist)
into the _path_ of the request. E.g. <code>/artist/1234</code>. We will configure Granitic to extract that ID and inject it
into the ID field of the <code>ArtistRequest</code> struct you defined above.

All of the automated tasks associated with a Granitic web service endpoint are handled by the [handler.WsHandler](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/ws/handler#WsHandler)
struct.

If you open the file <code>resource/components/components.json</code> you will see:

```json
"artistHandler": {
  "type": "handler.WsHandler",
  "HTTPMethod": "GET",
  "Logic": "ref:artistLogic",
  "PathPattern": "^/artist"
}
```

The component <code>artistHandler</code> is an instance of [handler.WsHandler](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/ws/handler#WsHandler) and we
can define how path binding will work through configuration. Change the definition of your <code>artistHandler</code> component so it looks like:


```json
"artistHandler": {
  "type": "handler.WsHandler",
  "HTTPMethod": "GET",
  "Logic": "ref:artistLogic",
  "PathPattern": "^/artist/([\\d]+)[/]?$",
  "BindPathParams": ["ID"],
  "CreateTarget": "es:endpoint.ArtistRequest"
}
```

### Capturing data in request paths

We've altered the regular expression that this endpoint expects to 

<code>^/artist/([\d]+)[/]?$</code>

so that in order to match an incoming request, the request path _must_ include a number and an optional trailing slash. We've
also defined a [regular expression group](https://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html) around the part of the path that
will be considered as representing the requested ID.

We've also added a new field <code>BindPathParams</code> and set it to an array of strings. The number of strings in this
array should match the number of groups in the <code>PathPattern</code> regex. Here we are saying that the value of the first regex group
should be injected into a field called 'ID'.

### Parsing data into a struct

The line:

```json
  "CreateTarget": "es:endpoint.ArtistRequest"
```

in the component definition above tells Granitic that incoming data (in the HTTP request body, path and parameters) should 
be parsed into a new instance of the struct <code>endpoint.ArtistRequest</code>.


Change your <code>ArtistLogic</code> struct to look like:

```go
type ArtistLogic struct {
  EnvLabel string
  Log      logging.Logger
}

func (al *ArtistLogic) ProcessPayload(ctx context.Context, req *ws.WsRequest, res *ws.WsResponse, ar *ArtistRequest) {

  a := new(ArtistDetail)
  a.Name = "Some Artist"

  res.Body = a

  l := al.Log
  l.LogTracef("Request for artist with ID %d", ar.ID)

}
```

Notice that we are now implementing a method called `ProcessPayload` rather than `Process`


Stop, rebuild and restart your application:

<pre>
grnc-bind && go build && ./recordstore -c resource/config,resource/env/production.json
</pre>

Visiting [http://localhost:8080/artist](http://localhost:8080/artist) will now result in a 404 Not Found error, but visiting [http://localhost:8080/artist/1234](http://localhost:8080/artist/1234) should
result in a response and a log line similar to:

<pre>
09/Oct/2017:12:44:13 Z TRACE [artistLogic] Request for artist with ID 1234
</pre>


## Binding query parameters

The technique for binding query parameters to your 'target' object is very similar to that used for binding path parameters. 
Edit your <code>components.json</code> file and add the following to the definition
of your <code>artistHandler</code> component:

```json
   "FieldQueryParam": {
      "NormaliseName": "normalise"
   }
``` 

and add the following Go to the end your <code>ArtistLogic.ProcessPayload</code> method:

```go
  if ar.NormaliseName != nil && ar.NormaliseName.Bool() {
    a.Name = strings.ToUpper(a.Name)
  }
```

Rebuild and restart your application. Visiting [http://localhost:8080/artist/1234?normalise=true](http://localhost:8080/artist/1234?normalise=true) will now
cause the returned artist's name to be capitalised.
 
## Extracting data from the request body

Path parameters and query parameters are only useful for submitting limited amounts of semi-structured data to a web service. More common is to use a POST or PUT request to include more complex data in the body of an HTTP request. Granitic has built-in support for accepting data in an HTTP request
body as JSON or XML. The following examples all use JSON, refer to the [facility/ws](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/facility/ws) and
[ws/xml](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/facility/ws) GoDoc to discover how to use XML instead.

We will create a new endpoint to accept details of a new artist as POSTed JSON. Add the following to your <code>artist.go</code> file:

```go
type SubmitArtistLogic struct {
  Log      logging.Logger
}

func (sal *SubmitArtistLogic) ProcessPayload(ctx context.Context, req *ws.WsRequest, res *ws.WsResponse, sar *SubmittedArtistRequest) {

  sal.Log.LogInfof("New artist %s", sar.Name)

  //Hardcoded 'ID' of newly created artist - just a placeholder
  res.Body = struct {
   ID int
  }{0} 

}

type SubmittedArtistRequest struct {
  Name string
  FirstYearActive *types.NilableInt64
}
```

This defines new endpoint logic that will expect a populated <code>SubmittedArtistRequest</code> to be supplied
as the [ws.WsRequest](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/ws#WsRequest).RequestBody. 

In order to have this code invoked, we will need to add the following to the <code>components</code> map in our <code>components.json</code> file:

```json
"submitArtistLogic": {
  "type": "endpoint.SubmitArtistLogic"
},

"submitArtistHandler": {
  "type": "handler.WsHandler",
  "HTTPMethod": "POST",
  "Logic": "ref:submitArtistLogic",
  "PathPattern": "^/artist[/]?$",
  "CreateTarget": "es:endpoint.SubmittedArtistRequest"
}
```

Check your <code>config.json</code> file and make sure the <code>GlobalLogLevel</code> is set to <code>INFO</code>

<pre>
grnc-bind && go build && ./recordstore -c resource/config,resource/env/production.json
</pre>




### Testing POST services

Testing POST and PUT services is more complex than GET services as browsers don't generally have built-in mechanisms for 
setting the body of a request. There are several browser extensions available that facilitate this sort of testing. The following
instructions are based on [Advanced Rest Client (ARC) for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo)

## POST a new  artist


1. Open ARC
1. Set 'Request URL' to  <code>http://localhost:8080/artist</code>
1. Change the method picklist to <code>POST</code>
1. Click on *Body* and set *Body content type* to <code>application/json</code>
1. Enter the 'test JSON' below into the large grey text area
1. Press <code>SEND</code>
1. You should receive a JSON formatted response with an ID of 0 and see a log line similar to: <code>09/Oct/2017:14:11:15 Z INFO  [submitArtistLogic] New artist Another Artist</code>


### Test JSON

```json
{
  "Name": "Another Artist",
  "FirstYearActive": 2010
}
```

## Recap

 * Granitic can extract data from the path, query and body of an HTTP request and bind it to your custom Go structs.
 * All this behaviour is configurable by changing the configuration of your handler components
 * Handler components are instances of [handler.WsHandler](https://godoc.org/github.com/graniticio/granitic/v2/ws/handler#WsHandler)
