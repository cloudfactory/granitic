# Principles of runtime control
[Reference](README.md) | [Runtime Control](rtc-index.md)

## DevOps friendly administration of persistent services

Runtime Control allows DevOps team members to control Granitic applications remotely, via scripts or from the terminal
without having to add 'admin' endpoints to that service's API.

## Built-in commands for most common use cases

Granitic provides [built-in commands](rtc-built-in.md) for managing the lifecycle (shutdown/suspend/resume etc) and
log levels of your application.

## Full support for custom commands

Commands you create will be automatically available via the command line tool and API.
